------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Presentation: ~
lh-map-tools.tar.gz contains three |plugin|s which define many functions
and commands that I use to program |mapping|s and |abbreviations|.
Thus, they are not aimed at final users, but at vim (ft)plugins developers.

Nevertheless, the two bracketing oriented plugins can be integrated very
easily into your system. The typical way to use them is to copy them into your
{rtp}/plugin/ directory and customize/define the different |ftplugins| you
will be confronted to. You could find (complex :-(() applications of this
bracketing system into my ftplugin files : vim_set.vim, tex-smart_chars.vim,
ML_set.vim, html_set.vim and |cpp_set.vim|.

							*misc_map.vim*
misc_map.vim~
			For Vim version 5.7. and more

This plugin defines several functions and commands to be used when you want to
program mappings and abbreviations:
|MapNoContext()|	for context dependent mappings,
|MapNoContext2()|
|MapAroundVisualLine()|	that inserts a pair of tokens around a visual area,
|BuildMapSeq()|		that expands mappings contained into strings, 
|EatChar()|		function that eats the <space> ending abbreviations.

In the future, I will certainly move it to the {rtp}/macros/ directory.

					*MapNoContext()* *MapNoContext2()*
MapNoContext({key}, {sequence}) & MapNoContext2({k},{s})~

These two functions enable to define context-dependent macros -- |mapping|s
and |abbreviations|. Regarding the context of the character under the current
position of the cursor, the functions return either the {key} or the
interpreted {sequence}. The {key} is returned when the context corresponds
either to comments, strings or characters. In a C program, I let you test the
following mapping within comments, strings or anywhere else : >
	Inoreabbr if <C-R>=MapNoContext('if', 
		\ 'if() {\<CR\>}\<ESC\>?)\<CR\>I')<CR>
<
Regarding the difference between the two functions, the second form is
relevant to define |mapping|s (not |abbreviations|!) when you are up to use
variables like "tarif".
Indeed, if the character before the cursor is a 'keyword' character, the key
is returned instead of the interpreted {sequence} ; cf. 'iskeyword' for more
information about keyword characters. 

Reserve the first form of the function to "keyword-less" {keys}, like the
opening curly-bracket for instance, or |abbreviations|.

Regarding the format of the {sequence} to interpret, every special character
must see its greater-than and lesser-than symbols escaped with
backslash. Thus <esc> becomes '\<esc\>'.

						*MapAroundVisualLine()*
MapAroundVisualLine({begin}, {end}, {isLine}, {isIndented})~

This helper function is dedicated to the addition of text around visual
selection. {begin} is added before the selection while {end} is added just
after. The function accepts two options that indicates whether the mapping
should be line wise and whether the selected text should be re-indented after
the operation.

At this time, it is mainly used in my LaTeX plugin in order to define things
like : >
    vnoremap ]ec :call MapAroundVisualLines('\begin{center}',
        \ '\end{center}',1,1)<CR>
>
It also fits perfectly to define the C & co. dedicated visual mappings : >
    vnoremap ,else :call MapAroundVisualLines('else {', '}',1,1)<CR>
<
Rem.: there are still problems with the indenting and more precisely when a
text is |smartindent|ed under VIM 5.xx ; it seems to work fine with VIM 6.0.
BTW, never use stuff that could be expanded as an |abbreviation| within
{begin} or {end}. Unless you like oddities.

Sometimes, the name of this function will be eventually:
AddTextAroundVisualSelection().

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
							*BuildMapSeq()*
BuildMapSeq( {sequence} )~

This function is aimed at enabling recursive (only one level) context
dependent mappings. Actually, it expands every mapping of the form
'¡.*!' and build a string that can be used as second parameter by the
|MapNoContext()| functions.
The expanded mappings are considered to be dedicated to the |INSERT-mode|.

My first aim for this function was to be able to use |markers| within
context-dependent macros.

Here is an example of what I have done with some C++ constructs : >
    Inoreabbr for <C-R>=Def_Map(
        \ 'for', 
        \ '\<c-f\>for (;;) {\<cr\>}\<esc\>?(\<cr\>a',
        \ '\<c-f\>for (;¡mark!;¡mark!) '
	\   . '\<cr\>¡mark!\<cr\>}¡mark!\<esc\>?(\<cr\>a')<CR>

    function! Def_Map(key, expr1, expr2)
      if exists('b:usemarks') && b:usemarks
        return "\<c-r>=MapNoContext2('"
	   \  . a:key."',BuildMapSeq(\"".a:expr2."\"))\<cr>"
      else
        return "\<c-r>=MapNoContext2('".a:key."', \"".a:expr1."\")\<cr>"
      endif
    endfunction
<
Then, within normal context, when |b:usemarks| is set, "for" is expanded into: >
    for (;«»;«») {
        «»
    }«»
and the cursor placed just after the opening parenthesis.

					*EatChar()* *:Inoreabbr* *:Iabbr*
EatChar({pattern}), :Inoreabbr, :Iabbr~

If you have always dreamt of |abbreviations| that do not insert the <space>
you typed to make it (the abbrev.) expand, this function is for you ! 

Let's suppose you want to map "if<space>" to "if ()<left>". Doing this is
quite easy thanks to |imap|. But it does not display the characters as you
type them, unless you use |iabbr|. Unfortunately, this time when you type
"if<space>", a space will be added between the parenthesis. That's not what
you want either.

The function proposed here, and the two commands |:Iabbr| and |:Inoreabbr|
address this problem. Define your abbreviations thanks to these commands, and
spaces won't show up. 

N.B.: I am not the original author of this tip. You have to thank Bram
Moolenar, Benji Fisher and some other people on the VIM mailing list
(|mail-list|) for this. The version I propose in my file does not support
multi-byte characters for the moment.

							*bracketing.base.vim*
bracketing.base.vim ~
			For Vim version 6.0.+ only

						*markers* 
						*¡mark!* *¡jump!* *¡jumpB!*
This file defines the bases of the bracketing system I use. What I propose
here is an improvement over Stephen Riehm original system -- you could find the
whole package with an important documentation and other remarks on Benji
Fisher's homepage. Stephen Riehm introduces several language-independent
mappings to manage brackets-like characters. He also introduces two
interesting global mappings : |¡mark!| and |¡jump!| ; and I add |¡jumpB!|.
They are used to mark (with text markers) positions within the file edited and
jump to them.


						*marker* 
						*b:marker_open* *b:marker_close*
As I do not expect the same things from a bracketing system when I am
developing in C++ or writing LaTeX documents, I have conducted a little
modification on the original system. I added the possibility to dynamically
change the text markers used -- «» is fine for me except within French LaTeX
documents. It is achieved through two buffer-relative variables (options):
|b:marker_open| and |b:marker_close|. I keep the same default values than the
ones chosen by Stephen Riehm. All the other mappings have been conserved if
you wish to use this file as Stephen Riehm initially planned to. 

I have also added some other features:
						*g:marker_prefers_select*
(*) The option |g:marker_prefers_select| (default 1) determines if the text
    (comment) within a |marker| should be echoed or if the whole marker should
    be selected (in |SELECT-mode|) -- from a Gergely Kontra's idea. Beware
    one thing: the SELECT-mode is considered to be a declension of the
    |VISUAL-mode|. Hence all the |imap|s won't expand in SELECT-mode!
    Fortunately, he |iabbr|s will still expand.

						*g:marker_select_empty_marks*
(*) The option |g:marker_select_empty_marks| (default 1) determines whether an
    empty marker should be selected or deleted when a |¡jump!| is encountered.
    Only works if |g:marker_prefers_select| is set. 

(*) The next markers are searched according to the 'wrapscan' option.


BTW, I map |¡mark!| to <M-Insert>, |¡jump!| to <M-Delete>, and |¡jumpB!| to
<M-S-Del>. 
If you'd rather use other keybindings, then add into your .vimrc something
like: >
	imap <C-J>	<Plug>¡jump!
	 map <C-J>	<Plug>¡jump!
	imap <C-K>	<Plug>¡jumpB!
	 map <C-K>	<Plug>¡jumpB!
	imap <C-<>	<Plug>¡mark!
	vmap <C-<>	<Plug>¡mark!
<

							*common_brackets.vim*
common_brackets.vim ~
			    For Vim version 6.0.+ only

This file eases the insertion of brackets pairs. It is used by quite all my
consequent ftplugins. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Main features~
								*b:cb_*
Through a set of buffer-relative options -- cf. the implementation and the
different other language ftplugins of mine -- , it enables and configures
bracketing mappings. 

The bracket-like pairs supported are : 
* parenthesis:      ( and ), 		*b:cb_parent*
* brackets:         [ and ],  		*b:cb_bracket*
* curly-brackets:   { and }, 		*b:cb_acco*
* comparison signs: < and >, 		*b:cb_cmp* *b:cb_ltFn* *b:cb_gtFn*
* single-quotes:    ' and ', 		*b:cb_quotes*
* double-quotes:    " and ",		*b:cb_Dquotes* *b:cb_DqFn*
* and dollars: $ and $ for LaTeX mathematical mode.	*b:cb_mathMode*

The different mappings, described in the following paragraphs, are activated
only when the corresponding buffer-relative options |b:cb_| are set to 1.
These options are not meant to be changed dynamically, but to be set once
within |ftplugins|.

Some behaviors can be tuned much more finely with callback functions:
|b:cb_DqFn| for double quotes, |b:cb_ltFn| for '<' and |b:cb_gtFn| for '>'.
Cf. ML_set.vim and vim_set.vim for examples.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How it works~

When we hit (in |insert-mode|) the starting character of a pair, the second
one is automatically inserted. In |visual-mode| (resp. |normal-mode|) the
opening character can be hit once -- except for quotes and dollars that have
to be hit twice -- in order to insert the pair around the visual area (resp.
current word).  

Pressing the second character from the pair puts the cursor just after the
next occurrence of this character (and in |insert-mode|). But you'd better use
|¡jump!| in conjunction with the |markers|. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dynamic (de-)activations~

When |Trigger.vim| is installed, the macros defined here can be activated and
deactivated as a whole by pressing <F9>.

								*b:usemarks*
In |insert-mode|, two operating modes are provided: one very classic and one
that takes advantage of Stephen Riehm's markers when the buffer-relative
option |b:usemarks| is set to 1. In that latter case, markers are inserted at
the end of the pair of brakets.  
The option can be toggled by hitting the trigger <M-F9> -- if |Trigger.vim| is
installed.

Accessibility~

For personal and technical (the meta-mappings do not suit to the layout of my
French keyboard) reasons, I prefer to use the opening character of a
bracket-like structure in order to insert the whole structure. 

In insert and normal modes, it is also possible to hit <Meta> + the opening
character to insert the corresponding structure around the current/previous
word -- this is not fully supported on French keyboards and is incompatible
with Stephen Riehm's default meta-mappings.

						    *brackets_manipulations*
Brackets manipulations~

I have stolen some functions from auctex.vim, and integrated them into
common_brackets.vim because they are not useful only to LaTeX edition.

(*) When in |insert-mode| a backslash is under the cursor, and we hit the
    opening character of a pair of "brackets", then another backslash is added
    before the closing "bracket".
(*) In |normal-mode|, we can :
    - delete a pair of brackets                  : with <M-b>x or <M-b><Delete>
    - change a pair of brackets to parenthesis   : with <M-b>(
    - change a pair of brackets to square ones   : with <M-b>[
    - change a pair of brackets to curly ones    : with <M-b>{
    - toggle the backslash on a pair of brackets : with <M-b>\

						*brackets_manipulation_mode*
Actually, by default, there is only one mapping (to <M-b>) that makes VIM
enter a brackets manipulation mode (much like |i_CTRL-X|). From there, you can
hit 'x', '<delete>', '(', '[', '{', or '<F1>' that will behave like exposed
earlier, or display a little help message.

If you don't want of this brackets manipulation mode, in your .vimrc enforce
*g:cb_want_mode* to 0. It values 1 by default.

		    *BracketsManipMode()*
		    *<Plug>DeleteBrackets* *<Plug>ChangeToRoundBrackets*
		    *<Plug>ChangeToSquareBrackets* *<Plug>ChangeToCurlyBrackets*
		    *<Plug>ToggleBackslash*
Again, if you don't like the default keybinding, with vim 6.0+ you can change
them into your .vimrc with something like: >
    noremap <silent> <C-L>b	:call BracketsManipMode("\<C-L>b")<cr>
otherwise, if |g:cb_want_mode| is left to 1, define: >
	map	<C-L>bx		<Plug>DeleteBrackets
	map	<C-L>b<del>	<Plug>DeleteBrackets
	map	<C-L>b(		<Plug>ChangeToRoundBrackets
	map	<C-L>b[		<Plug>ChangeToSquareBrackets
	map	<C-L>b{		<Plug>ChangeToCurlyBrackets
	map	<C-L>b\		<Plug>ToggleBackslash
>
